# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze Blinkit grocery sales, using data cleaning, advanced Excel functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS), and pivot tables. I designed dynamic visualizations with slicers and filters to track sales trends, product performance, and outlet analysis, enhancing my data analysis and reporting skills.
